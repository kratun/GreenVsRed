# GreenVsRed
Console Application that represent 2D matrix game.

## IDE
```
Visual Studio v 16.6.5 or any other software that allows you to start .Net Core App 3.1 applications<br />
```

## How to run
Find and loaded the file GreenVsRed.sln from the directory where you downloaded it.</br>

## Game Description
1. In our game we assume that matrix has x (width) and y (height) where x<=y<1000, so max x,y is 999</br>
2. On a frist line you should write width and height of the matrix, they must be integers separated by comma ",". If one or both are out range ( width[0,max see 1.] or height [0, max see 1.]) you will receive a error message. If one or both are not an integer you will receive error message. After each error message you have to write the dimensions again.
3. On the next line you will receive message "Please enter on each next {height} lines, {width} digits({1} for green or {0} for red)" and on the next Nth lines you have to write each row of the matrix. If you write less/more digits(1s or 0s) than the matrix width or row contains not correct digits you will receive error message and after that you have to write it again.</br>
5. Atfer height correct lines you have to write three integers separated by comma "," (target Point X and Y and Rounds). Target Point is a cell in the matrix for which you will like to calculate how many times it becam green from the initial matrix till the matrix generate in the last round. Rounds is an integer and it is used as a property how many times you want to change the matrix.</br>
